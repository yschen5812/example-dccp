# example-dccp
This project is just an example of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Congestion_Control_Protocol"> DCCP</a>. <p>It is compiled using make on the linux terminal.</p>

<p>
It is important to note that DCCP can actually be carried in UDP packets. DCCP is by no means a popular format, it has a lot of potential but the RFCs which established have never moved beyond a "proposed standard" as of this projects creation; this was merely done as an experimental endeavour.
